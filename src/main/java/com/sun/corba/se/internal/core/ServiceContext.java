/** Base class for all ServiceContext classes.

* the ORB supports.  Each subclass encapsulates the representation of
* the service context and provides any needed methods for manipulating
* the service context.  Each subclass must provide the following 
* members:
* <p>
* <ul>
* </li>a public static final int SERVICE_CONTEXT_ID that gives the OMG
* (or other) defined id for the service context.  This is needed for the
* registration mechanism defined in ServiceContexts. OMG defined 
* service context ids are taken from section 13.6.7 of ptc/98-12-04.</li>
* <li>a public constructor that takes an InputStream as its argument.</li>
* <li>Appropriate definitions of getId() and writeData().  getId() must
* return SERVICE_CONTEXT_ID.</li>
* </ul>
* <p>
* The subclass can be constructed either directly from the service context
* representation, or by reading the representation from an input stream.
* These cases are needed when the service context is created and written to
* the request or reply, and when the service context is read from the
* received request or reply.
