/**
 * The Key interface is the top-level interface for all keys. It
 * defines the functionality shared by all key objects. All keys
 * have three characteristics:
 *
 * <UL>
 *
 * <LI>An Algorithm
 *
 * <P>This is the key algorithm for that key. The key algorithm is usually
 * an encryption or asymmetric operation algorithm (such as DSA or
 * RSA), which will work with those algorithms and with related
 * algorithms (such as MD5 with RSA, SHA-1 with RSA, Raw DSA, etc.)
 * The name of the algorithm of a key is obtained using the
 * {@link #getAlgorithm() getAlgorithm} method.<P>
 *
 * <LI>An Encoded Form
 *
 * <P>This is an external encoded form for the key used when a standard
 * representation of the key is needed outside the Java Virtual Machine,
 * as when transmitting the key to some other party. The key
 * is encoded according to a standard format (such as 
 * X.509 <code>SubjectPublicKeyInfo</code> or PKCS#8), and
 * is returned using the {@link #getEncoded() getEncoded} method.
 * Note: The syntax of the ASN.1 type <code>SubjectPublicKeyInfo</code> 
 * is defined as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * SubjectPublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
 *   algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
 *   subjectPublicKey BIT STRING }
 *
 * AlgorithmIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
 *   algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
 *   parameters ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * For more information, see 
 * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2459.txt">RFC 2459: 
 * Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile</a>.
 * <P>
 *
 * <LI>A Format
 *
 * <P>This is the name of the format of the encoded key. It is returned
 * by the {@link #getFormat() getFormat} method.<P>
 *
 * </UL>
 *
 * Keys are generally obtained through key generators, certificates,
 * or various Identity classes used to manage keys.
 * Keys may also be obtained from key specifications (transparent
 * representations of the underlying key material) through the use of a key
 * factory (see {@link KeyFactory}).
